# Create a PDF using iText 7 and JPype
* [IText7](https://itextpdf.com/en/products/itext-7/itext-7-core)
* [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


The primary java classes listed [here](https://api.itextpdf.com/iText7/java/7.2.2/) have been extracted and rejarred into `itext.7.2.2.jar` for version 7.2.2 
Note: I have also included the dependencies these classes use (i.e. slf4j, log4j, and bcp)

## Please do not redistribute the jar like this as this is only an example meant for educational purposes. 
* The third party libraries should be distributed seperately as far as I can tell!
Here are the jars contained in this zip
